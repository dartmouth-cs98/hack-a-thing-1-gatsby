# Hack-a-Thing: Dart.cs using Jekyll

- For our hackathon we decided to explore static site generation and new deployment strategies. After looking at both Gatsby.js and Jekyll, we decided to go with Jekyll. We then deployed using Now.sh.

- Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby. It allows you to simply package up your content files and functionality and share it across projects. We learned a little bit about static site generators in CS52 (namely, Hugo), but we wanted to try out Jekyll as a different and potentially better option for any future simple site endeavors.

- The problem we chose to address is a lack of organization when it comes to computer-science-related information at Dartmouth. We thought it would be really cool to start a blog run by students for students to share advice and info related to courses, job and internship prep, study abroad opportunities, and more.

- Jekyll has nice support for "categories" which is how every post on the blog is tagged into a category so that a user can simply navigate to a list of posts under a specific category via the navigation bar on the top left.

- We also became familiar with how to customize a Jekyll theme by replacing .scss files from the installed Gem into the project directory and making preferred changes within the copied file.

- Finally, having experience deploying with Surge, we decided to use the competing Now.sh. It was REALLY easy to use. Type `now` and your site is deployed. Wow!
